## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science, essential for efficiently storing, organizing, and manipulating data. Mastery of data structures is crucial for writing efficient algorithms and developing robust software applications. This repository aims to provide comprehensive explanations, implementations, and examples for a variety of data structures.

## Available Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures are included in this repository:

- [Arrays](https://github.com/Dragonflip/datastructures/blob/master/src/01_Array.ipynb)
- [Stacks & Qeueus](https://github.com/Dragonflip/datastructures/blob/master/src/02_Queue.ipynb)
- [Linked Lists](https://github.com/Dragonflip/datastructures/blob/master/src/03_LinkedList.ipynb)
- [Trees](https://github.com/Dragonflip/datastructures/blob/master/src/04_Tree.ipynb)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps

Each data structure is organized into its own directory, containing relevant documentation, implementations in various programming languages, and examples illustrating its usage.
